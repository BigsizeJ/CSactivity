# BSCS 1st Year Project Solo

Hi! I'm Jessie. This is the program that i created in my Computer programming subject.
i choose to be not in group for a reason that i will know where i left off and know what the code does. i find it more efficient. 


# Documentation
There is 6 sample program i created in 1 file. i create a menu function to navigate what program you want to use and you can go back to menu if you finish using the program you choose.

The one is **Age program** what it does is you input your name and your birth day, birth month and birth year. and the console will return what you input but it will show you what is going to be your age this year.

The second one is **Calculator** it pretty much self explanatory. i create a simple calculator with no GUI just console.

The third one is **Order System** it simulate the order system in fast-food restaurant. the console show the food you can order and you will need to input your money and also ask you to buy a drinks and at last it will return your money but subtracted it to what you ordered. it also ask you if it's take out or dine in. there is different approach you can try it or you can copy paste or modify it as you like.

The fourth one is **Grading System** it only has 4 subject variable. Math. Filipino. English and Science. you put your grade in those 4 subject and it will calculate your Average grade and convert to College Grading System.

The fifth one is **Sort** it prompt you to input any words and the program sort the word you input to A-Z. it pretty much a mess of a code because i create it fast and the final result is just a mess but it does it's job.

The last one is **ATM** it also pretty much self explanatory. what it does is simulate the ATM in real life to console but it's not perfect it can improve to higher level but in this project i will keep it simple. i also use **Random Module** for random money inside the ATM to create a twist in the program.

**NOTE**
i create the program using Python3
